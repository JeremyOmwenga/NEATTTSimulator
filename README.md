# AI car simulator
This is a 2D AI car simulator that attempts to see how fast a car can make it around a track.
The car is controlled by radar sensors that detect collisions i.e. when th car collides with the edge of the track.
The car is also part of a model that runs in the NEAT algorithm. The algorithm runs populations of cars through generations, with each subsequent generation of cars having attributes inherited from the previous generation.
# Installation
Clone the github repo to your local machine.
The necessary libraries are called from the main program so simply run the python script to start the simulation
